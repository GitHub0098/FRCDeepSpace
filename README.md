# Branches

Master - Default branch that should contain code that passes build and should be ready to run on the Robot

PowerUp - Branch for testing code to be run on the PowerUp chassis, which is meant to be our test chassis
 - Should never be merged back into master

SnobotSim - Branch that should be even with master for deploying code to the [SnobotSim](https://github.com/pjreiniger/SnobotSim/wiki/Setting-Up-The-Simulator) instead of the robot.
 - Used for testing code at home or anywhere without access to the robot
 - Must be rebased often in order to stay even with master branch
 - Must never be merged back into the master branch
