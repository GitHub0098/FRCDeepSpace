# FRCDeepSpace
This the code written by Team 1100 for the 2019 FRC game, Destination: Deep Space.

If you notice a problem with this repository, please submit an issue.

We will be commenting our code towards the end of the season, to help future programmers.

# Vision
In order to get vision working on this robot, you must implement ChickenVision on a RaspberryPi 3 connected to the robot. Refer to [Team1100/ChickenVision](https://github.com/Team1100/ChickenVision).

# Branches

Master - Default branch that should contain code that passes build and should be ready to run on the Robot

PowerUp - Branch for testing code to be run on the PowerUp chassis, which is meant to be our test chassis
 - Should never be merged back into master

Testing - Branch that tests all robot functionality through SmartDashboard
 - Must be rebased often in order to stay even with master branch
 - Must never be merged back into the master branch
